## Computational Understanding of Narrative Engagement


Do you enjoy reading fiction? We are interested in studying how text in stories affects readersâ€™ engagement in order to improve natural language processing (NLP) models.

### Eligibility

The data collected during this experiment is gaze data, i.e., the focal coordinates of the pupil on the display screen, as well as pupil diameter and responses to comprehension questions. Data is sampled at a rate of 2000Hz by the eye tracking machine. This work is conducted under PI, Prof. Dongyeop Kang
